    <h1>Reading books</h1>
    <p>I didn't like to read books when I was very young, but in the high school I felt in love with it. <br>
    I think I was just bored and picked a random book and actually liked it. <br>
I think it was novels compilation of Thomas Mayne Reid and I liked the American West esthetics. <br><br>

After the high school I started to learn Russian literature in University of Latvia. <br><br>

My most favorite author is Ernest Hemingway. And "A Farewell to Arms" is my most favorite Hemingway's novel. <br><br>
