    <h1>Playing video games</h1>
    <p>Video games always have been part of my life since childhood. Our family got our first PC in the late 90's. 
    I don't even remember what we played back then, but I definitely loved it.</p>

    <p>I still do love it. However, I can't spend that much time on gaming now like back then.</p>

    <p>One of my most favorite games are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li> <br>

            <li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt <em>(especially Blood & Wine DLC)</em></li><br>
