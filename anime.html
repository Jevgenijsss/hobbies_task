    <h1>Watching anime & reading manga</h1>
    <p>Even before I saw my first anime, I was reading books about world history and different cultures. <br>
    I think I was about 7 years at that point. And already then I was attracted to the Asian and Japanese culture particularly.</p>

    <p>I think the first anime that I've ever seen was Pokemon when I was about 9 years old. <br>
    I didn't even know what anime is at that point. I just like a cartoon with cute creatures.</p>

    <p>Few years later I saw Naruto and Shaman King on the TV and I felt in love with it. <br>

    <p>A couple of years later I only found that anime is based on manga. And I found out reading manga can be even more interesting than just watching anime. </p>
    <p>My favorite title at this moment is "Golden Kamuy". <br>
    I like the setting as it's connected to the world history. It is Japan after the Russo-Japanese war. <br>
In short, it is about a man, Saichi Sugimoto, that is looking for a treasure to heal and provide his friend's widow of his dead comrade.</p>
